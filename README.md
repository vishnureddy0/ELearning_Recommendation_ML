# LearningStylePrediction_ML

Learning management systems are widely used in educational organizations and universities to deliver self-paced online courses. Furthermore, educational theories have suggested that providing learners with learning material suitable for their learning styles may affect their learning performance. 

Human brains generally use different methods for grasping knowledge faster and easier. We call these methods as learning styles. Learners with different individual traits, levels of knowledge, backgrounds, and characteristics have different learning styles. Determining student's learning style improves the efficiency of the learning process. A model for accurate automated learning style recognition is needed to provide personalized learning content to the student based on his/her learning style. 

In this work we implement an intelligent model for accurate detection of student’s learning styles.
